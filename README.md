# mdbook_vpreprocessor

Demonstrates that an array of sum type of PreprocessorContext and Book can't be used to decode MDBook into aforementioned structs.

## To Run

```
mdbook build
```

## Test

The commented parts in test can be uncommented to demonstrate.

Note: because mdbook compiler expects stdout, any printed line is not outputted to terminal yet consumed by the compiler.

- To output to terminal use panic()
